1.  What are important features of Java?

Platform-independent,  

2.  What is platform-independent?

Java's executable file known as .class file can be executed on any platform irrespective of the plaftform on which it was complied.

3.  What is bytecode?

The code generated by the Java compler is known as bytecode.

4.  What is JVM?

The Java executable library known as JVM.  OR the part of JDK responsible for the executon of Java bytecode is known as JVM.

5.  Can we get JVM separately to buy in the market?

Yes, available.  Ex: browser requires only JVM to execute applets.

6.    What is class?

A class is a basic unit code Java code.

7.  What a class contains?

A class contains variables, methods, constructors.

8.  What is a method?

A method is a reusable chunk of code placed in a class.

9.  What are the properties of a method?

A method comes with 3 properties - return type, parenthesis and body.

10.  What is an instance variable?

An instance variable is declared in class and not in any method.  The scope of instance variable is for the whole class.

11.  What is object?
An instance of a class is known as object.

12.  
How to create an object?

Creation of object involves the usage of new keyword and constructor.

13.  What is new keyword does?

It allocates memory for the newly created object.

14.   What a constructor does?

The constructor returns a class object, but without a name.  That is, a constructor returns an anonymous object.

15.  Why main() method must be public?

To allow the JVM to call the main() without any restrictions of access.  

16.  Why main() method must be static?

To allow the JVM to call the main() without the help of an object.

17.  Why we require a string array as parameter to main()?

To access the command-line arguments we use the string array.

17.  What are command-line arguments?

Arguments passed to a main() method along with execution command.

18.  What are oops concepts?

Encaspulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

19.  What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as as single unit.

20.  What is inheritance?

The relation established between two classes is known as inheritance.

21.  What is the advantage of inheritance?

Due to inheritance, a class (subclass) can make of other class (super class) properties (as it they belong to its own).

22.  What is the advantage of encapsulation?

Due to encasulation, the same property (instance variable) can be given different values (of course by calling with objects).

23.  What is polymorphism?

Same method performing different activities (functinalities) is known as polymorphism.

24.  What is static polymorphism?

Polymorphism achieved through compilation is known as static polymorphism.

25.  How to achieve static polymorphism?

By method overloading, we achieve static polymorphism.

26.  What is method overloading?

Defining the same method in the same class but with different parameters is known as method overloading.

27.  Does C-lang support method overloading?
No, does not support.  (supported by OOPs languages like c++ and Java).

28.  What is the property of return type in method overloading?
Return may or may not the same in method overloading.

29.  What is dynamic polymorphism?

Polymorphism achived at runtime is known as dynamic polymorphism.

30.  How to achieve dynamic polymorphism?

By method overridng we achive dynamic polymorphism.
The other property we use is object casting where a subclass object is assigned to super class object.

31.  What is static binding?

In static binding which overloaded method is to be called is decided at compile time itself by the compiler.

32.  What is dynamic binding?

In dynamic binding which overridden method is to be called is decided at runtime.

33.  Where to apply static keyword?

static keyword is applied to instance variables and methods (but not to classes and constructors).

34.  What is purpose of static?

A static variable or method can be called without object.

35.  When to use static?

When we would like to give a single value for all the objects of the class, we use static.

36.  With static can we maintain encapsulation?

No, with static variables, encapsulation cannot be maintained.

37.  What is method overriding?

If the super class and the subclass have the same method, we say super class method is overridden by subclass.
(In method overriding, the parameters, rerurn type should be the same).

38.  What is the difference between mehod overloading and method overriding?

Refer table in class notes

39.  What is final keyword?

final keywords says in general that something cannot be done.
final keyword can be applied to variables, methods and classes.  (but a constrctor cannot be final).

A final variable cannot be reassigned.
A final method cannot be overridden.
A fina class cannot be inherited.

40.  Can a local variable be static?

No. Only instance variables can be static .

41. Can a local variable be final?

Yes, both instance and local variables can be final.

42.  What is abstract keyword?

abstract is keyword of Java that can be applied to methods and classes. (but not to constructors and variables).

43.  What is the use of abstract method?

It is to force the sublcass to override.

44.  What the properties of abstract method?

a)  an abstrct method does not have a body (including empty body).
b)  all the abstract methods of the super class must be overriden by subclass.
c) with abstract calss we cannot create objects (but we can create reference variables).
d)  if one of the methods of a class is abstract, the class must be declared abstract.

45.  What is the keyword we with abstract classes to inherit?
extends.

46.  What is an interface?

Interface contains all abstract methods.
All methods should be abstract and public.  If omitted, taken by default.

47. Why interfaces introduced?

Just support multiple inheritance.

48.  Does Java support multiple inheritance?

Basically Java does not support multiple inheritance but supports partially through interfaces.

49.  What the properties of interfaces?

a) With like abstract classes, we cannot create objects (but reference variables are possible)
b)  all the abstract methods of the interface should be overridden by subclass.

50.  What keyword should be used in interfaces while inherting?
implements

51.  Can we assign a subclass object to super class object?
Yes, it is done implicitly also.  

52.  Can we assign a super class object to sub class object?
Not possible by implicit.  But possible my explicit casting.

53.  Whar is this keyword and where to use it?

this keyword refers always the current object.
With this keyword, we differentiated a local variable with an instance variable (when both clashed).

54.  What is constructor?

A constructor looks like a method but without return type and more over, the constructor name and class name should be the same.

55.  What are the advantages of constructors?
a) constructor is used to create an object.
b) with constructor, we can assign the properties to an object at the object creation itself.

56.  What is composition?

Creating object one class in another class is known as compositon and is known as "is-a" relationship.

57.  What is shallow copying?

To give properties one object to another by directly object assingnment is known as shallow copying.  With shallow copying, encasulation is not maintianed.

58.  What is deep copying?

Assinging properties one object to another by assigning each variable separately is known as deep copying and with this encapsulation is maintained.

59.   What is constructor overloading?

Using the same constructor in the same class but with different parameters is known as constructor overloading.

60.  What is abstraction and how it differs from encasulation?

61.  Why Java avoid multiple inheritance?

Extending more than one class is known as multiple inheritance.  If two super classes have the same method, it is ambiguity for the JVM to call which method of two classes.
To avoid this ambiguity, Java does not support multiple inheritance.


62.  Can abstract class have all concrete methods and not containing atlest one abstract method?

Yes, it can have.

63.  What are the variations of abstract class?

An abstract class can contain

a) 
all abstract methods
b) all concrete methods
c)  a mixture of abstract and concrete methods 


64.  What is the difference between abstract class and interface?

See notes

65.  

a)  public:

    class, instance variable, methods and constructors
    But not local varaibles. 

b) protected

     instance variables, methods and constructors
     But not classes and local variables

c)  default

       class, instance variable, method and constructor also local vaiables

d)  private:
 
      only methods and instance variables

66.  Can a constructor be private?

By rule a constructor cane be private.  But a private constructor in super class is prohibited as subclass constructor cannot call super class private constructor.


67.  How to prohibit a class not to be extended without using final?

Declare the constructor as private in super class.

68.  

decimal numbers, octal numbers, hexa numbers

69.  What are the variables of Math class?

public static final double E;
public static final double PI;

70.  Can interface have variables?

Yes, it can have.  By default interface variables are public, static and final.

We know methods are by default public and abstract.

Being final, interface variables cannot be overriden in subclass.

71.  Combination of calling between methods

1.  A non-static method called from another non-static method.  Works

2.  A static method called from another non-static method.  Works  

3.  A non-static method called from static method.  Error

			STRINGS

1.  What is string immutability?



		PACKAGES

1.  What is a package?

A package is a group of related classes and interfaces.

2.  What are advantages of packages?

a)  With  a single import statement, we can get all the classes and interfacs into RAM so that our program can utilize them.

b)  We can import even a single class of a package also which is not possible in C/C++.

c)  We can avoid namespace problems.

3.  What is the meaning of namespace problem?

In the context of packages, having two same classes in the RAM is known as namcespace problem.  This can be avoided by using qualified name.
Ex: importing java.util and java.sql gets us two Date classes.  This leads to namespace problem.

4.  What is qualified name?

Writing he name of the class along with package is known as qualified name.
Ex:  java.util.Date

5. Does Java permit to create our own packages?

Yes, Java permits.

6.  How to create a package?

Write a package keyword before class name and compile.  It creates a package.

Use -d option of javac to create a package.

7.  What is the order of package statement?

1.  First there must be package statement.
2.  In second place, there may be a import statement (optional)
3.  Third one must be class declaration.

8.  What is environment variables?

Variables given by OS envitornment to talk or communicate with running OS are known as environment variables.

Ex: path, classpath. %path%, %classpath% and also .

9.  Where to use path and classpath?

When we load any software  we get two types of folders - bin (containing binary files) and lib (containing library files).

To recognize the software by the OS, we must set the classpath with lib folder and bin folder with path.

. means the current directory.

IO  Streams

1.  What is unicode?

Java's character size is 2 bytes and its range is known as unicode range that comes between 0 to 65,535.  The big range includes alphabets of nearly 20 languages.

Where as C-lang range char takes 1 bytes with a range of 0 to 255 and is known as ASCII range.

2.How many types of IO streams exist in Java?

Two streams - Byte Stream and character stream

1.  Byte stream operates on bytes (0 to 255 knonw as ASCII) introduced with JDK 1.0 version.

2.  Character stream operate4s on characters (0 to 65,535 known as unicode) introduced with JDK 1.1 version.

ASCII operates on english characters only where as unicode operates on english and also other languages like Latin-1, Latin-extended, Telugu etc.

For enlish file coying we can use both byte and character streams because ASCII code is subset of uncode.

3.  How many types of IO  classes exist?

Byte streams comes with two types iknown as input classes and output classes.
Character streams comes with two types reader classes and writer classes.

Functionality of input classes and reader classes is to open the file in read mode and also contain the methods for reading the file.

Functionality of output classes and writer classes is to open the file in write mode and also contain the methods for writing to a file.

All input stream classes end with InputStream, output stream classes end with OutputStream, reader classes end with Reader and writer classes end with Writer.

Ex:
Input stream classes:  FileInputStream, DataInputStream, BufferedInputStream etc.

Output stream classes:  FileOutputStream, DataOutputStream, BufferedOutputStream etc.

Reader classes:  FileReader, BufferedReader etc.

Writer classes:  FileWriter, BufferedWriter etc.

All 4 types of classes put together comes around 50 classes.

==============================================

                                                    Threads
One of the features of Java is that it supports multithreading.

What is multitasking?

Shiting the microprocessor to execute another process when the running process is stopped it's execution for some reason is known as multitasking.

Ex:

1.  Listening to music while typing ms-word document.
2.  Doing some work on the system while a file is being downloaded.
3.  Railway reservation system with many clients and one server.

What is multiprocessing?

Adapting more than one microprocessor so that two processes can be fed is known as multiprocessing which is not common as all desktop systems contain single processor.

What is multithreading?

Multithreading is the style of Java to achieve multitasking.  Now Java divides a process into multiple threads.  Each thread can be given different task.  If one thread stops its execution, the control can be shifted to another thread.

Using threads Java achieves multitasking.

Def:  Shifting the execution control between two threads when one stops its execution is known as multithreading.

What is a thread?

Def:  A thread is a single sequential flow of control within a process.

Elaborate the above statement:

A process can be divided into a number of threads where each thread comprises of a few statments (instructions).  The advantage of dividing into threads is if one thread stops its execution, the control can be shifted to another thread; but whole process does not stop.

If no threads exist, the whole process stops.  This is known as "monolithic programming".

More explanation:

A thread lives within a process.  No process no thread.

What is heavyweight and lightweight processes?

Shifting the execution control between the threads of different processes is known a heavyweight process.

Shifting the execution control between the threads of same process is known a lightweight process.

Generally Programmer creates lightweight threads as they are faster than heavyweight threads.

How to create a thread in Java?

There are two ways to create thrads in Java.

1.  By extending Thread class (from java.lang package)  OR
2.  By implementing Runnable interface (from java.lang package)

Extend Thread class, create a object, the object automatically becomes a thread.

When to use Runnable?

If by chance our class extends another class, then we can prefer Runnable interface as Java does not support multiple inheritance.

What is thread priority?

Java allows to give priority to threads.  The thread with more priority is given earlier change than the thread with less priority.

A thread can to be given priority ranging from 1 to 10;

Two methods exist in Thread class to manage priorities.

a) public void setPriority(int num)    b)  public int getPriority()

With setPriority() we can set a priority and with getPriority() we can know or retrieve the priority of a thread.

What is synchronoization in threads?

To see the multiple threads executes in an orderly fashion is knwon as synchronization.  In synchronization, Programmer will see one thread acts on one source of data.  If another thread comes, it is put in a queue oustside.

How to synchronize in Java?

A complete method or a block of statements of a method can be synchrinized.  We use here synchronized keyword.  synchronized is used as an access modifier.

public synchronized void update(double balannce)
{
     this.balance = this.balance - balance;
     System.out.println("Hello");
}

In the above method, both immportant and unimportant statements are syunchronized.  Instead we can synchronize only important or critical data only as follows.

public void update(double balannce)
{
    synchronized(this)
    {
         this.balance = this.balance - balance;
    }
     System.out.println("Hello");
}

When a synchronized block is called by a thread,  the JVM calls wait() method.  It means that no other thread can access the synchronized mehod unitl the first one vacates it by calling notify() or notifyAll() method.

wait() and notify() methods are defined in Object class inherited by Thread class and used exclusively with thread synchronization.

 public final native void notify();
  public final native void notifyAll();
  public final void wait() throws InterruptedException;


wait() and notify() method defined in which class?

They are defined in Object class.


What is racing in threads and starvation threads?

A number of thread may be competing for the processor.  This is knownas racing the threads.  Thread scheduler is the authority on behalf of OS to allow which thread should go first and the other later.  It prepares a chart.  Thread scheduler is a complex algorithm executed very often to prepare a fresh chart.

In this creation of quite often, there may be some threads which do not get the processor time.  These are known as "starved threads".

Likely to get the processor time for the starved threads, the Prorammer can call yield() mehod.  yield() method defined in Thread class will halt the current thread execution for a minute time.  Here, scheduler recalculates the alogorith.  In this recalculation, the starved may get a chance.


                                     Thread Life Cycle

Different states in which a thread exist between its object creation and garbage removal is knonw as life cycle of thread.

There are four important states:

1.  born state
2.  Runnable state
3.  blocked state
4.  dead state


What is deadlock?

Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.   A Java multithreaded program may suffer from the deadlock condition because the synchronized keyword causes the executing thread to block while waiting for the lock.

=========================================

			DS

What is Enumeratoin interface?

Enumeration is an interface from java.util package.  It itself is not a DS but used by many DS to print their values.

How to get an object of Enumeration?

The elements() method of Vector returns an object of Enumeration.

What are the methods of Enumeration interface?

There are only two methods in Enumeration interface.

1.  hasMoreElements() that returns boolean value
2.  nextElement() that returns an element

Using the above two methods, we can retrieve the elments present with Enumeration object.

What is daemon thread?

Daemon thread is a background thread which serves other threads.  It is created by JVM before any thread and removes after every thread removed.
Good example is Garbage collorctor.

Daemon threads are given least priority as other processes are important to execute like giving output to the user before garbage collection.

There are two meathods in Thread class to work with daemon threads.

a) d1.setDaemon(true) where the thread d1 is converted into daemon thread.

b) getDaemon() retuns true or false used by Programmer to know a thread is daemon or not.

How many ways are there in Java to bring a thread from runnable to blocked state and back.

     Runnable to blocked state		Blocked state to Runnable state

1.   sleep(time)			implicitly comes back to runnable
				when sleep time is over.

2.  





2.  suspend()			resume()

3.  wait()				notify() or notifyAll()

4.  input to a ruuning process		when input is over
     like keyboard or typing
     ms-word document.


What is generics?

Aceepting only one type of elements by DS is known as generics. A feature introduced with JDK 1.5

What is the difference between Vector and ArrayList?

1.  Vector methods are synchronized  and of ArrayList are not.

2.  This this reason, Vector is best suitable in a multithreaded environment.  Where multithreaded environment is not there prefer ArrayList.

3.  Being synchronized mehtods. Vector performance is slower than ArrayList.

4.  Vector is a legacy class introduced with JDK 1.0 and where as ArrayList was introduced with JDK 1.2 and forms part of collections framework.


What are the methods of Enumeration interface?

1. hasMoreElements() returning boolean value
2. nextElement() returns an object of Object class

What are the methods of Iterator interface?

1. hasNext() returning boolean value
2. next() returns an object of Object class


What are the methods of ListIterator interface?

ListIterator is sub interface of Iterator.  Being sub interface, the ListIterator can make use of Iterator methods.

ListInterator make use of Iterator methods to iterate the elements.  It adds some extra methods also like add().

1. hasNext() returning boolean value  (inherited from Iterator)
2. next() returns an object of Object class  (inherited from Iterator)

Iterator methods can be used by all collection classes but ListIterator can be used by only the subclasses List iterface.


Is Map interface and its concrete subclass HashMap are part of collections framework?

Yes, they are part only eventhough does not belong to Collection interface heirarchy.  They are placed separatelty because they store key/value pairs.  All other DS store only elements.

That is, each element in Map comprises of key/value pair.  Similar class in JDK 1.0 is Hashtable.

What is the method that returns a Set object with keys of HashMap?

keySet().

What is the similarity between Hashtable and HashMap?

Both store key/value pairs.

What is the super class of TreeSet?

SortedSet interface.

What are features of TreeSet?

1.  Being subclass of Set interface, stores unique elements.
2.  Being subclass of SortedSet interface, prints elements in asceding order known as natural order.

What is the difference betweeen Hashtable and HashMap?

All methods of Hashtable or synchronized and best suitable for multithreaded programming where as HashMap methods are not synchronized.
Hashtable introduced with JDK 1.0 and part of legacy classes.
HashMap introduced with JDK 1.2 and part of collectrions framework.

Are there any classes to sort the elements of a DS?

Yes, there are two.  Comparator interface and Comparable interface.

=====================================================

How many ways we can take keyboard input in Java?

There are three ways.

1.  Using byte streams with DataInputStream
2.  Using character streams with BufferedReader
3.  Using java.util.Scanne class.

The disadvantage with the first two is parsing of the keyboard input is required.
With the last one, parsing is not required.  Scanner was introduced with JDK 1.5 to make keyboard input code easier.

Scanner class comes with methods like nextInt(), nextDoubl() etc.

Which package Scanner belongs and what are its methods?

Scanner class is from java.util package and not from java.io package.
The methods available are next() returns a string, nextInt() returns an int value and nextDouble() returns a double value directly where parsing is not required.


What is in, out and err defined in Java or explain System.out.println()?

Open java.lang.System class:

 public static final InputStream in;
  public static final PrintStream out;
  public static final PrintStream err;

in is an object of InputStream class.
out and err are objects of Printstream.
All defined in System class as public, static and final objects.

Internally, in is connected to OS keyboard stream and out and err are connected OS output streams.  

That is, in stream OS is represented by java as an object of InputStream.  This in in object we connecting to System.in

What is System.in?

in is an object of java.io.InputStream defined in System class as public, static and final.  In interally System.in is connected to the in stream of OS.  Using System.in we read keyboard input.

Explain System.out.println()?

out is an object of PrintStream defined in System class as public, static and final.
println() is a method of PrintStream class (overloaded 10 times accepting different type of parameters like int, double, string etc).

Can we use System.err.println()?

Yes, we can use but not comfortable with err as it indicates error message and best suitable to write in catch block.

public class KeyboardInput
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
               System.err.println('A');
               System.err.println(10);
               System.err.println("hello");
    }
}

============================================================


Ultimately, System.out.println() prits at DOS prompt or command-prompt.

What is System.out.println()?

println() is a method of PrintStream class.
out is object of PrintStream defined in System class.

===============================================

		Garbage collection

What is garbage?

   The unwanted objects and variables generated while code is being executed is known as garbage.

   In Java, gabage collection is implicit and is one of the features of Java.  
   In Java, either memory creation or removal is automatic or implict. For this reason, Java does not support the memory functions like malloc(), calloc(), sizeof(), delete() or free() etc.

What is finalize() method in Java?

If the Programmer would like to do any activity, he can write that code in finalize() method.  finalize() method is called implicitly by JVM before an object is garbage collectiod.  Programmer can use the finalize() method to write the clean-up code like closing of file streams, sockets and JDBC connections etc.

What is the signature of finalize()?

finalize() method is defined in Object class and thereby inheritaed by all classes. It is defined as protected.  Following is the method signature:

             protected void finalize() throws java.lang.Throwable;

  That is, finalize() method can be used by subclasses (other packages) only.

===============================

Give one example on static polymorphism?

Method overloading leads to static binding and static polymorphism.  An example is same calculate() method can calculate areas of different geometrical figures.

Give me differences between static and dynamic polymorphsim?

1.  SP occurs with method overloading. DP occurs with method overriding.

2.  SP is achieved at compile time and DP is at runtime.

3.  SP occus within the same class as DP between classes involved in inheritance.


Difference between method overloading and method overriding?

1.  MOL takes different parameters.  MOR same parameters.

2.  MOL return type may or may not be the same.  MOR return type should be same.

3.  Inheritance not involved in MOL.  In MOR inheritance is involved.

4.  Happens within the same class in MOL.  In MOR occurs between two classes - super class and subclass.

5.  MOL leads to static binding and static polymorphism.  MOR leads to dynamic binding and dynamic polymorphism.

============================================

Creating arrays:


int marks[] = new int[5];    or int[] marks = new int[5];  // is is correct way.

In array creation (not initialization), both sides there must be same data type, 
Size must be mentioned.  Size cannot be long data type.

int marks = new int[5];  // error
int marks[] = new int];  // error
int Student[] = new int[5];  // error

Student std[] = new Stuedent[5];  // no error

Questions on array initialization

int marks[] = { 10, 20, 30 };   // no error
int marks[3] = { 10, 20, 30 };   // error in Java but not in C/C++.  Size of the array in array intialization in C/C++ is optional.  But giving in Java is compilation error.








			Strings
String s1 = "hello";

System.out.println(s1.length);  // error as length is a method in Strings and where as in arrays, length is a variable.

int marks[] = new int[5];
System.out.println(marks.length);  // correct way

String s1 = "hello";
System.out.println(marks.length());  // correct way


String s1 ="hello";
s1.toUpperCase();
System.out.println(s1);  // prints hello

String s2 = s1.toUpperCase();
System.out.println(s2);  // prints HELLO

String s1 ="hello";
s1.replace('h', "H');
System.out.println(s1);  // prints hello


========================================

Difference between final, finally and finalize?

final and finally are keywords (not methods) of Java doing different jobs. No comparison between them because they work for different jobs. finalize() is a method.

1. final

Keyword final can be applied in three places – variables, methods and classes and in each place they it perform different jobs.

2. finally

Keyword finally is used in combination with try block in exception handling. The statements of finally block are guaranteed of execution.

3. finalize

finalize() method is from Object class. It is called by the JVM before an object is garbage collected.

What is InputStreamReader?

It is an adopter or converter of byte stream to character stream.  We use this in keyboard input using BufferedReader as follows:

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

==========================================================
		Serialization

What is serialization?

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a special stream of bytes so that they can be written to a file or send across distributed network. 

Serialization gives guarantee that when the object is retrieved back either from the file or network, the object maintains the same properties.


Note:  With serialization, the state of the object is maintained.  When state is maintained, the data is persistent.  When data is persistent, we get back the same data what we stored earlier.

Where we use serialization?

Serialization is used whereever objects are written to file or send across network like in RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and Hibernate (JDBC framework) etc.

What is desrialization?

Converting stream of bytes into orginal object format is known as desrialization.


How to serialize an object?

Just implement Serializable interface to the class declaration.  When an object is created, JVM automatically serialize the object.

	public class Student implements Serializable

What is marker interface?

An interface which does not contain any methods is known as marker interface or tag interface or empty interface.

What marker does?

It gives special instructions to the JVM about the special treatment to the object. For example, SingleThreadModel is implemented to the Servlet, the server creates only object of the servlet, inspite of many requests from the clients.

What is the advantage of marker interface?

1.  Programmer need not override any abstract methods.
2.  It instructs the JVM to give special treatement for the object.

What are the empty interfaces in Java?

MAKER INTERFACE NAME	FUNCTIONALITY

1. java.io.Serializable		the object is serialized
2. java.lang.Cloneable	the object is cloned
3. javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel	only one object of the servlet for one request is created


4. javax.ejb.EnterpriseBean	the object can participate in transactions
5. java.util.RandomAccess	the elements of the data structure can be randomly retrieved fast (introduced in jdk1.5)
6. java.rmi.Remote		the object can invoke the methods on a remote 				machine
7. java.util.EventListener	All event listeners extend this interface

What are the IO streams used in writing and reading a serialized object?

Following two streams uses objects.

1.  ObjectInputStream with readObject() method
2.  ObjectOutputStream with writeObject() method


		About inner classes

/*               Inner classes(Nested classes)

Java supports inner classes.  A class declared in another class is called inner class or nested class. It is to restrict  the accessibility to other classes.  Inner classes were introduced in JDK 1.2 version to support the usage of anonymous inner classes with adapter classes.

Scope of variables in nested classes:

  a) The inner class can access outer class variables.

  b) But, the outer class cannot access inner class variables.
       
*/

public class OuterOne
{
    int x = 10;
    class InnerOne
    {
       int y = 20;
       public void inner()
       {
         System.out.println("From inner class: " + y);
         System.out.println("From inner class: " + x);
       }
    }                                // close inner class
    public void outer()  // it is outer class method
    {
      System.out.println("From outer class: " + x);
      // System.out.println("From outer class: " + y);          //  Error
    }
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
         OuterOne oo = new OuterOne();
         oo.outer();

         OuterOne.InnerOne io = new OuterOne().new InnerOne();
          io.inner();
    }
}

/*
   Inner class object can be created as follows also:
  
   OuterOne.InnerOne io = oo.new InnerOne();

          When we compile the above program, we get two .class files as follows:

	OuterOne.class
	OuterOne$InnerOne.class

which indicates that we cannot create an InnerOne class object directly.  It must be created through OuterOne.

 ======================================

We can have:

1. class inside class
2. interface inside a class
3. class inside an interface
4.  interface inside an interface

Can a class be declared static?

It is possible in only one case.  An inner class can be static.

======================================================

                                       Singleton object

What is Java Singleton ?

1.  Singleton is a design pattern. 

2.  This designing style allows the programmer to create only one object of the class; even if more than one is created, it is not an error, but the code allows only one.

3.  In singleton class, there will be always only one object functioning, at a given time.


Simple definition:  Allowing a class to create only one object is known as singleton class and singleton object.

Advantages of Java Singleton

Database connection takes a long time.  That is, a language takes more time to connect to database.  To avoid this, Programmer can limit the database connections to one only with sigleton class.


How to create a singleton class or what are the special steps taken in creating a singleton class?

4 steps to implement in singleton creation

1.  Make the constructor private not to be accessed directly
2.  Create a method that returns a singleton object
3.  Apply synchronization to the method to be thread-safe
4.  Override clone() method for not allowing to clone the singleton object

Singleton example:

public class Student
{
  private int marks;                 // assigned with default 0
  private static Student std;        // assigned with default null
 
  private Student() 
  {     
     // some code if required
  }
  public static synchronized Student getMe()
  {
    if(std == null)
    {
      std = new Student();  
    }
    return std;
  }
 
  public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException
  {
     throw new CloneNotSupportedException("Not allowed on this singleton object");
  }
 
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
      Student std1 = getMe();
      Student std2 = getMe();
 
      std1.marks = 50;
      std2.marks = 60;
      System.out.println("std1 marks when std2 changes: " + std1.marks);   // 60
 
      std1.marks = 70;
      System.out.println("std2 marks when std1 changes: " + std2.marks);    // 70
 
      System.out.println("\nstd1 hash code: " + std1.hashCode());
      System.out.println("std2 hash code: " + std2.hashCode());
  }
}
=========================================

                                         Reflection API

What is Reflection in Java?

Studying the properties of a class at runtime is known Reflection (in JavaBeans, this is called as Introspection). 

What are properties of a class?

The properties include knowing the instance variables, constructors and methods with their access specifiers and modifiers. 

Who uses Reflection?

Generally reflection is used by JVM and tools that loads a class and do operations on the class like calling methods and accessing constructors etc. 

==========================================================

		Exception Propagation

What is exception propogation?

An exception is first thrown from the top of the stack and if it is not caught, it drops down the call stack to the previous method, If not caught there, the exception again drops down to the previous method, and so on until they are caught or until they reach the very bottom of the call stack.  This is called exception propagation.

================================================
		instanceof operator

// usage of instanceof keyword used as operator.  instaneof is not a mehod.  We say, instanceof evaluates to but we cannot say instanceof returns as instanceof is not a method.

// instanceof operator evaluates an object belongs to a class or not.  If belongs, it evaluates to true else false.

// instanceof evaluates to true even if the object is checked with its super class.

// The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type (type of a class). 

class Test {  }
public class Demo extends Test
{
    public static void main(String args[])
     {   
             Demo d1 = new Demo();
             Test t1 = new Test();
   
             if(d1 instanceof Demo)
             {
                  System.out.println("d1 belongs to Demo class");
             }
     
             if(t1 instanceof Test)
             {
                  System.out.println("t1 belongs to Test class");
             }

            if(d1 instanceof Test)  // d1 is checked with its super class
             {
                  System.out.println("CCCCC");
             }
            if(d1 instanceof Object)
             {
                  System.out.println("KKKKKK");
             }

     }
}
=================================================

                                      transient keyword

transient keyword is used as access modifier with variables only.  That is, transient cannot be applied to classes and methods.

transient is used an access modifier with variables.

Ex:   public transient int marks = 50;

A transient variable is not serialized.

Generally all the variables attached with a serialized object are also serialized.  If the Programmer does not want to serialize certain data of a serialized object, he declares these variables as transient.  

The transient variable data is not written to the file or send across network.
==================================================

			volatile keywowrd

The Java volatile keyword is used to mark a Java variable as "being stored in main memory". More precisely that means, that every read of a volatile variable will be read from the computer's main memory, and not from the CPU cache, and that every write to a volatile variable will be written to main memory, and not just to the CPU cache.

volatile is applied to variables but not classes and methods.

eg: public volatile int marks = 50;

                           JDBC

What is JDBC?

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity.  It is a concept using which a Java program (like a Servlet or JSP or EJB) connects to a database and do manipulations on database.

What is a driver?

Driver is a software which connects dissmilar softwares or two dissimilar products like Java to database or mouse to OS etc.

What is the return of type of executeUpdate()?

ex:    int x = stmt.executeUpdate("delete from Employee where empid=101");

The return type is int.  The int reflects the number of records affected with the SQL command passed as parameter.


What is batch update in JDBC?

Generally, every executeUpdate() method hits the database.  That is, if three executeUpdate() statements are there, database is hit three times.  This kiils the performance.

To overcome this, batch updates are introduced.  With addBatch() methods, all the SQL commands are made as one unit.  With executeUpdate() mehod the unit is executed once.  That is database is hit only once.

stmt.addBatch("delete Employee where empid=102");

stmt.executeBatch();  


How many Statements are there in java.sql package?

Three are there used for different purpose.

1.  Statement interface - used to execute general SQL commands

2.  PreparedStatement interface - used to execute dynamic SQL statements

3.  CallableStatement interface - used to execute procedures and functions (known as 			stored procedures)

Which methods of Connection interface return the objects of the above 3 interfaces?

1.  createStatement() method of Connection interface returns an object Statement interface.

2.  prepareStatement() method of Connection interface returns an object PreparedStatement interface.

3.  prepareCall() method of Connection interface returns an object CallableStatement interface.


How many JDBC drivers are there ?

4 types.

1.   JDBC-ODBC Bridge, plus ODBC driver (known as bridge driver)
2.   Native-API, partly-Java driver
3.   JDBC-net, pure Java driver
4.   Native-protocol, pure Java driver  (this is known as thin driver)


(separate notes in ms-word file is attached)

		SERVLETS

What is servlet?

Any Java program written as per Servlet API specifications is called as a servlet.

Sun Microsystems (now purchased by Oracle) developed the Servlet API specifications.

Servlet is used in web based communication.

What is web based communication?

Where client and server communicates using web (with http protocol) is known as web communication.

Or, where client and server uses HTTP protocoal to communicate is known as web communication.

How to write a servlet?

To write servlet there are three ways.

1.  By implementing Servlet interface

Drawback of using this:  We must override all the abstract methods which we do not want also.

2.  By extending GenericServlet (it is abstract class)

Drawback of using this:  This is old style used by Developers when HTTP protocol was not standardized for Web.

3.  By extending HttpServlet (it is abstract class)

Advantages:  This is the latest and developed to suit HTTP protocol by adding some extra classes and extra methods to the existing classes.


What is service() method?

service() method is a callback method called automatically when servlet is loaded by the web server.

Not imprtant:  service() is a callback method which is abstract method in Servlet interface and GenericServlet.  But service() is a concrete method in HttpServlet.  That is, when we extend GenericServlet, we must override service() method else error. But the designers made service() as concrete method in HttpServlet so that Developer can use other methods instead of service() like doGet() and doPost() methods.

Wrting doGet() and doPost() with GenericServlet does not work as server thinks they are user-defined methods and utimately servlet does not execute. These methods are not defined in GenericServlet but defined in HttpServlet.

What are the parameters of service() method when GenericServlet is extended?

The two parameters are objects of ServletRequest interface and ServletResponse doing different jobs.

What are the functionalities (purpose) of ServletRequest and ServletResponse?

ServletRequest job is to receive data from client. From req object, the Programmer can extract data and use in his code.  ServletResponse job is to send data or to client.  The Programmer can pass the data to res to send to client.

Explain res.setContentType("text/html");    ?

setContentType(String) is a method of ServletResponse interface whose job is to set the MIME type.

What is MIME type?

MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension.  Programmer uses MIME type to inform the client browser of what type of data is being sent herewith.

Or to say, information to the client browser in which format the data should be interpreted that is being sent by the servlet.

Explain     PrintWriter out = res.getWriter();  ?

getWriter() is a method of ServletResponse that returns an object of PrintWriter.

println() is a method of PrintWriter.
